## React – Tic-Tac-Toe

The task in this activity was to do the following:

Display the next player to play (Player X or Player O). This should show which player’s turn it is. 
It should be updated every time a player selects a square

Update the color of the mark based on the player’s turn. “X” should be red, and “O” should be white.
